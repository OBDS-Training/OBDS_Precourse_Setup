# Installing git on Windows 10

- In your web browser, navigate to <https://git-scm.com/download/win>.
- Click on `Click here to download manually`
- Run the installer
  + In the screen `Choosing the default editor used by Git`, choose `Use Atom as Git's default editor`.
  + Leave all other options to their default choice, unless you have specific reasons not to.

  You can test your installation as follows:

  - Launch the Windows PowerShell from the Start Menu.
  - Type `git`

  This should display a message indicating the main `git` subcommands.
