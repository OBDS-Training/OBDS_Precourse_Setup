# Create a GitHub account

During the course, we will explain what GitHub is and how to make the most of it.
To save some time, one thing we do ask is that you create a GitHub account prior to commencing the course.

## Instructions

- In your web browser, navigate to <https://github.com/>
- In the top-right corner, click on the button labelled `Sign up`.
- Fill the form
    + Choose a unique username.
    + Use a stable email address; either your university email or your personal email address.
    + Pick a strong yet memorable password; you will need to use it regularly when managing your GitHub account.
    + Click the button `Create account` when you are ready.
- Make sure that you follow the instructions to validate your account.
  For instance, you may be sent an email with a link to validate your email address.
