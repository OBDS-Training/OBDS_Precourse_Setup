# Virtual Private Network (VPN) client setup

Before you can access the remote server that we use for the course,
you will need to connect to the University Virtual Private Network (VPN).

The University provides comprehensive instructions to install and configure
the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client on this page:
<https://help.it.ox.ac.uk/vpn>.

We recommend that you use the built-in VPN client on MacOS,
following instructions in the following sections of the link above:

- `VPN requirements`
- `Setup an alternate VPN client`

Alternatively, you may use the Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client,
in which case you should follow instructions in the following section instead:

- `Setup the Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client`
