# Connecting to the MSDIT Virtual Private Network (VPN)

Before you can access the remote server that we use for the course,
you will need to connect to the University Virtual Private Network (VPN).

The University provides comprehensive instructions to install and configure
the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client on this page:
<https://help.it.ox.ac.uk/vpn>.

In particular, if you do not have the VPN client installed on your computer yet,
you will need to download it from the [Software downloads page](https://register.it.ox.ac.uk/self/software).

Then, connect to the MSD IT Services VPN following the instructions on this page:
