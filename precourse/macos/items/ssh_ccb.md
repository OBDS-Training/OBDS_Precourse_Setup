# Log in the CCB cluster

The Center for Computational Biology (CCB)
at the MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine (WIMM)
hosts a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster
that is available to all members of the University of Oxford
for scientific computing.

You can [read more](https://www.imm.ox.ac.uk/research/units-and-centres/mrc-wimm-centre-for-computational-biology/ccb-account) on the institute's website.

Before the start of the course,
an account will be created for each of you,
and you will each be sent your login information, including:

- a username
- a password

To log into the cluster:

- Connect to the University VPN.
- Open the `Terminal` application on your computer.
- Type the following, replacing `<username>` by your own username (without the `<>` symbols).

```
ssh <username>@cbrglogin1.molbiol.ox.ac.uk
```

- When prompted for your password, type it and press the Return key on your keyboard.

> For security reasons, when you type your password, the characters will not be displayed in the Terminal.
> This is normal.
>
> Tip:
>
> If you are worried about mistyping your password,
> Open a text editor, type your password there, then cut and paste it in the Terminal application.
