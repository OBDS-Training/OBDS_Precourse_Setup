# Setting up R on MacOS

- In your web browser, navigate to <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/base/>.

- Click on `R-4.0.3.pkg`.

- Click on the downloaded file to run the installer.

Use all the default options, unless you have specific reasons not to.

- Test your installation by typing `R` in a Terminal.

This should launch an R prompt in the terminal, and the prompt should display a launch message indicating that it is using R version 4.0.3.

Alternatively, you can type `R.version` in the console, and you should see

```r
...
major          4
minor          0.3
...
```
