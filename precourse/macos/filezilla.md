# Installation of FileZilla

`FileZilla` is a program used to copy files between a local computer and a remote server.

## Downloading Filezilla for your system

- In your web browser, navigate to <https://filezilla-project.org>.
- On the web page, in the section 'Quick download links',
  click on the button 'Download FileZilla Client - All Platforms'.
- The website should automatically detect your operating system,
  and present you with a green button 'Download FileZilla Client'.

> Note:
> If you believe that the website did not detect the correct operating system,
> scroll down to the section 'More download options'
> and click on the icon of a suitable operating system.
> On that next page, click the green button 'Download FileZilla Client'.

The website should open a modal window asking you to select an edition of FileZilla Client.

- Click on the green button labelled 'Download' in the column called simply 'FileZilla'.

> Note:
> Do not click on the button 'Select' in the column called 'FileZilla with manual'.
> This will take you to FileZilla Pro, which is priced at Â£4.99.

This will finally download a compressed archive file - with a `.tar.bz2` extension - to your computer.

## Filezilla installation

- In `Finder`, go to the location of that file.
- Double-click the file to decompress it.
  This will generate a new executable file called 'FileZilla' in the same folder.
- Move the file 'FileZilla' to your 'Applications' folder.
  There are a couple of ways you can do this:
  + In your `Finder` window, in the side bar, the section 'Favourites' should include a link to the 'Applications' folder. You can simply drag and drop the file on that shortcut.
  + In your `Finder` window, in the side bar, the section 'Locations' should include a link 'Macintosh HD'; click on that link. The main panel should include the folder 'Applications'; drag and drop the file on that folder.

## Check your installation

  - Open the `Launchpad`, it should include the icon `FileZilla`; click on it.
  - The first time that you launch `FileZilla`, you may be presented with a MacOS security warning asking you whether you want to open this application downloaded from the web; click on the button 'Open'.

This should then present you with the application main window.

Success!
