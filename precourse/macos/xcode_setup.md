# Installing XCode

Some of the software packages that we will use during the course (e.g. git) require software development utilities that can be obtained by installing the _Command Line Tools_ for XCode.

_Note: this is only a pre-requisite for MacOS users. If you are not a MacOS user, please ignore this._

## Instructions

- In the `App Store`, find the [Xcode Developer Tools](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
  + Click the above link to go to the online Apple App Store
  + Click `Open App Store` when prompted, or click on the `View in Mac App Store` in the web page.
- This will install Xcode on your machine.
- In your `Applications` folder, launch `Xcode`. You may see the following window:

- If this is the case:
    + Click `Install`
    + You may be prompted for your password. If so, enter it.

- Once the installation is complete, the `Xcode` welcome screen will appear.

- You can simply close it; everything is ready.

You can test your git installation as follows:

- In a Terminal, type `git`.
- This should display a message indicating the main `git` subcommands.
