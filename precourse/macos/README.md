# Mac Laptop Setup

There are several pieces of software that you will need to install on your local computer (laptop / desktop) for use during the OBDS course.
Please install and test these using the instructions below before the start of the course.
If you already have some of those software on your computer, do make sure those are up-to-date versions; otherwise please install the required version, if applicable.

- Text Editor
    + We will use several different text editors to write code during the course.
    + While some will be installed during the course Atom can be [installed and configured](atom_installation_instructions.md) in advance
- Linux command line
    + We will need a local Linux terminal for remote connection to Linux servers
    + MacOS is unix-based and includes a builtin Terminal app.
    + You can use terminal to log in into the CGAT cluster using [SSH](cgat_login.md)
- Version control
    + To install Git on MacOS please install [XCode](xcode_setup.md)
- File transfer
    + We can use an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client to connect to remote servers to transfer files.
    + There are many free FTP clients. For the OBDS course we recommend [FileZilla](filezilla_instructions.pdf)
- X Window System
    + We will use the [XQuartz](xquartz.md) application.
- R and RStudio
    + The last three weeks of the course focus on the R statistical programming language.
    + We would like you to install up to date versions of both [R and the RStudio development environment](r_setup_macos.md) on your local computer.
