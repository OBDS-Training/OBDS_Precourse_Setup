# Installing git on Windows 10

The git source control manager software for windows comes with a linux terminal called git bash. The instructions below will install both git and git bash.

- In your web browser, navigate to <https://git-scm.com/download/win>.
- Click on `Click here to download manually`
- Run the installer
  + In the screen `Choosing the default editor used by Git`, choose `Use Atom as Git's default editor`.
  + Leave all other options to their default choice, unless you have specific reasons not to.

  You can test your installation as follows:

  - Launch git -> git bash from the Windows Start Menu.
