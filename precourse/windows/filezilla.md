# Installation of FileZilla

FileZilla is a program used to copy files between a local computer and a remote server.

In your web browser, navigate to <https://filezilla-project.org>.

On the web page, in the section 'Quick download links', click on the button 'Download FileZilla Client - All Platforms'.

The website should detect your operating system, and present you with a green button 'Download FileZilla Client'.

_Note: If you believe that the website did not detect the correct operating system, scroll down to the section 'More download options' and click on the icon of a suitable operating system. On that next page, click the green button 'Download FileZilla Client'._

The website should open a modal window asking you to select an edition of FileZilla Client.
Click on the green button labelled 'Download' in the column called simply 'FileZilla'.

_Note: Do not click on the button 'Select' in the column called 'FileZilla with manual'. This will take you to FileZilla Pro, which is priced at Â£4.99._

This will finally download a compressed archive file - with a `.tar.bz2` extension - to your computer.

In Finder, go to the location of that file.

Double-click the file to decompress it.

This will generate a new executable file called 'FileZilla' in the same folder.

Move the file 'FileZilla' to your 'Applications' folder.
Here are a few examples how to do that:

- In your Finder window, in the side bar, the section 'Favourites' should include a link to the 'Applications' folder.
  You can simply drag and drop the file on that shortcut.
- In your Finder window, in the side bar, the section 'Locations' should include a link 'Macintosh HD'; click on that link.
  The main panel should include the folder 'Applications'; drag and drop the file on that folder.
- In a Terminal, adapt the following command to wherever the file is currently located on your computer: `cp /your/own/path/to/FileZillla /Applications`

## Check your installation

Open the Launchpad, it should include the icon 'FileZilla'; click on it.

The first time that you launch FileZilla, you may be presented with a MacOS security warning asking you whether you want to open this application downloaded from the web; click on the button 'Open'.

This should then present you with the application main window.

Success!
