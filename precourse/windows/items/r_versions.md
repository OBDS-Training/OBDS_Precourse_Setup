# Managing multiple versions of R on Windows 10

We ask that you use R version 4.0.3 for this course.
Installing R 4.0.3 will not delete the other version(s) of R installed on you computer.
It is possible to switch between multiple versions of R, although only one version can be active at any one time.

- Launch `RStudio`.

- In the RStudio menu, click on `Tools`.

- Click on `Global Options...`.

- In the `General` panel, in the `Basic` sub-panel, next to the `R version:` field, click on the `Change...` button.

- Select `Choose a specific version of R:`.

- Select `[64-bit] C:\Program Files\R\R-4.0.3`.

- Click on `OK`.

- Restart `RStudio` when prompted.

This should relaunch `RStudio`, and the prompt should display a launch message indicating that it is using R version 4.0.3.

Success! You can close this application.
