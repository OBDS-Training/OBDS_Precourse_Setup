# Installation of FileZilla

FileZilla is a program used to copy files between a local computer and a remote server.

## Downloading Filezilla for your system

  - In your web browser, navigate to <https://filezilla-project.org>.
  - On the web page, in the section 'Quick download links', click on the button 'Download FileZilla Client - All Platforms'.
  - The website should detect your operating system, and present you with a green button 'Download FileZilla Client'.
  - _Note: If you believe that the website did not detect the correct operating system, scroll down to the section 'More download options' and click on the icon of a suitable operating system. On that next page, click the green button 'Download FileZilla Client'._
  - The website should open a modal window asking you to select an edition of FileZilla Client.
  - Click on the green button labelled 'Download' in the column called simply 'FileZilla'.
  - _Note: Do not click on the button 'Select' in the column called 'FileZilla with manual'. This will take you to FileZilla Pro, which is priced at Â£4.99._
  - This will finally download a compressed archive file - with a `.exe` extension - to your computer.

## Filezilla installation
