# Windows 10 Setup

There are several pieces of software that you will need to install on your local computer (laptop / desktop) for use during the OBDS course. Please install and test these using the instructions below before the start of the course.

- Text Editor
    + We will use several different text editors to write code during the course.
    + While some will be installed during the course Atom can be [installed and configured](atom_installation_instructions.md) in advance.
- VPN
    + The high-performance computing (HPC) cluster that we use for the course can only be accessed from the University VPN.
    + Please the University of Oxford IT services website for details of how to configure VPN access: https://help.it.ox.ac.uk/vpn
- Linux command line
    + We will need a local Linux terminal for remote connection to Linux servers
    + Installing [Git](git_setup.md) will install a local Linux terminal (Git bash) and the Git version control software at the same time. 
    + Once installed you can use Git Bash to log in into the [CCB cluster](ccb_login.md)
- Microsoft Remote Desktop (RDP)
    + We will use [RDP](microsoft_remote_desktop.md) for remote graphical access to the CCB cluster.
- File transfer
    + We can use an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client to connect to remote servers to transfer files.
    + There are many free FTP clients. For the OBDS course we recommend [FileZilla](filezilla.md).
