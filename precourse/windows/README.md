# Windows 10 Setup

You will need to install several pieces of software on your computer (i.e. laptop or desktop) for use during the course.
Please follow the instructions below to install and test those pieces of software before the start of the course.

If you already have some of those pieces of software on your computer, do make sure those are up-to-date and match stated version requirements, if any.

If you run into any issue while following the instructions below,
please save any error message or screen capture,
and send it to us along with a description of what you have done before the error occured.

## Text Editors

We will use several different text editors to write code during the course.
Some of them will be installed interactively during the course.

We ask that you install and configure the following progams in advance, following the instructions linked:

- VPN
    + The high-performance computing (HPC) cluster that we use for the course can only be accessed from the University VPN.
    + Please the University of Oxford IT services website for details of how to configure VPN access: https://help.it.ox.ac.uk/vpn
- Linux command line
    + We will need a local Linux terminal for remote connection to Linux servers
    + Installing [Git](git_setup.md) will install a local Linux terminal (Git bash) and the Git version control software at the same time. 
    + Once installed you can use Git Bash to log in into the [CCB cluster](ccb_login.md)
- Microsoft Remote Desktop (RDP)
    + We will use [RDP](microsoft_remote_desktop.md) for remote graphical access to the CCB cluster.
- File transfer
    + We can use an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client to connect to remote servers to transfer files.
    + There are many free FTP clients. For the OBDS course we recommend [FileZilla](filezilla.md).
