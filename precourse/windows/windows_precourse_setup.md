# Windows 10 Setup

### Software

There are several pieces of software that you will need to install on your local computer (laptop / desktop) for use during the OBDS course. Please install and test these using the instructions below before the start of the course.
- Text Editor
    + We will use several different text editors to write code during the course.
    + While some will be installed during the course [Atom](https://atom.io/) can be [installed and configured](../atom_installation_instructions.md) in advance.
- Linux command line
    + We will need a local Linux terminal for remote connection to Linux servers
    + Installing [Git](git_setup.md) will install a local Linux terminal and the Git version control software at the same time. We will use both on the course.
    + Once installed you can use Git Bash to log in into the CGAT cluster using [SSH](cgat_login.md)
- File transfer
    + We can use an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client to connect to remote servers to transfer files.
    + There are many free FTP clients. For the OBDS course we recommend [FileZilla](../filezilla_instructions.pdf).
- R and RStudio
    + The last three weeks of the course focus on the R statistical programming language.
    + We would like you to install up to date versions of both [R and the RStudio development environment](r_setup_windows.md) on your local computer.
