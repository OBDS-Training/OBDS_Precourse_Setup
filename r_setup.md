## Managing multiple version of R

We ask that you use R version 4.0.2 for this course.
Installing R 4.0.2 will not delete the other version(s) of R installed on you computer.
It is possible to switch between multiple versions of R.

Any new `RStudio` application that you open now will use R version 4.0.2.

## Git integration with RStudio

After following the instructions for [Setting up git](git_setup.md) and [Creating an SSH key pair](create_ssh_keypair.md), check that RStudio detects your `git` installation and your private SSH key.

- Launch `RStudio`.
- In the RStudio menu, click on `Tools`.
- Click on `Global Options...`.
- In the `Git/SVN` panel:
  + The `Git executable:` field should indicate the path to the `git` executable, e.g.
    * `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe` on Windows.
    * `/usr/bin/git` on MacOS.
  + The `SSH RSA key:` field should indicate the path to your private SSH key, e.g.
    * `C:\Users\Username\.ssh\id_rsa` on Windows.
    * `/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa` on MacOS.

Any field that displays `(Not found)` means that `RStudio` did not detect a working installation at any of the standard locations on your system.
Either relaunch `RStudio`, or try repeating the relevant instructions for [Setting up git](git_setup.md) or [Creating an SSH key pair](create_ssh_keypair.md), and relaunch `RStudio` again to apply the changes.
